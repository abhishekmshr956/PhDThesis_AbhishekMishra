%        A.A., M.S.D., and A.B. conceived the study and designed the experiments. A.A. conducted and analyzed the measurements of T4/T5 cell  responses. M.S.D.
%        designed the projector-based stimulation arena and performed and analyzed the measurements of the OFF-pathway elements. \textbf{F.G.R.} performed and analyzed the experiments describing the ON-pathway neurons. G.A. performed and analyzed the patch-clamp recordings from lobula plate tangential cells. M.S.D. performed the computer simulations. A.A. wrote the manuscript with the help of all authors.
